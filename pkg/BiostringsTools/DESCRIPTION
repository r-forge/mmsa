Package: BiostringsTools
Title: Interface to Tools for Biostrings (alignment, classification, database)
Description: Seamlessly interfaces several popular tools for sequence alignment (ClustalW, MAFFT, MUSCLE, Kalign), data base search (BLAST), classification (RDP) and a database to manage 16S rRNA sequences with Biostrings (from Bioconductor). The package includes a software installation wizard. This work is supported by grant no. R21HG005912 from the National Human Genome Research Institute.
